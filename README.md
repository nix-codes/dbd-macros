# What is this?
This project consists of a series of very simple macros for "Dead By Daylight" game that help to reduce the strain on your wrist as well as the wear and tear of your keyboard, especially if you dedicate thousands of hours to playing it.


# What can it do?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action                                     | Hotkey for enabling               | Hotkey for disabling
-------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:-------------------------------
_Hold M1_ (repairing gens; healing; etc.)    | Hold \<Left Mouse Button\> + \<Tab\>  | \<Left/Right Mouse Click\>
_Hold M2_ (healing; using toolbox; etc.)     | Hold \<Right Mouse Button\> + <Tab\> | \<Right/Right Mouse Click\>
_Wiggle on killer's shoulders_               | Hold \<~\>                          |
_Struggle on hook_                           | \<Tab\>                             | \<Tab\>
_Activate ability_                           | \<Mouse wheel down\>                |
_Flashlight spam_                            | Hold \<Middle Mouse Button\>        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Note:
The above actions depend on DBD config to be using the default keys for those actions.
_Struggle on hook_ &#8594; will press "space" key repeatedly
_Activate ability_ &#8594; will press "E" key when the mouse wheel scrolls down
_Flashlight spam_  &#8594; will press the right mouse button repeatedly
_Hold M1_          &#8594; will keep the left mouse button down
_Hold M2_          &#8594; will keep the right mouse button down




# Is this bannable?
No. This macro provides no competitive advantage for playing the game. It just offers alternative key bindings and/or automates minor actions that can be performed manually without skill requirement.


# How to install?
It's very simple and you have 2 choices:
1. Simplest way (using .exe file): Just download the exe file from the [releases page](https://github.com/nickyramone/dbd-macros/releases) and run it.
2. Using source script: Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com); download [dbd_macros.ahk](https://github.com/nickyramone/dbd-macros/blob/master/dbd_macros.ahk) from this site (or just copy/paste the script to a file of your own) and double click on it.
