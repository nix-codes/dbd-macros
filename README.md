# What is this?
This project consists of a series of very simple macros for "Dead By Daylight" game that help to reduce the strain on your wrist as well as the wear and tear of your keyboard, especially if you dedicate thousands of hours to playing it.


  
# What can it do?
* **Hold M1**                      &#8594; will hold the left mouse button down
  * For repairing gens, healing others, etc.
* **Hold M2**                      &#8594; will hold the right mouse button down
  * For using toolboxes, medkits, etc.
* **Wiggle on killer's shoulders** &#8594; will press "A" and "D" keys alternatively and repeatedly
* **Struggle on hook**             &#8594; will press "space" key repeatedly
* **Dead Hard**                    &#8594; will press "E" key
  * Useful for dead-hard'ing with the mouse wheel (which is naturally more comfortable and efficient than the "E" key). Of course, you could also bind the ability to the mouse wheel in game settings but the problem with that approach is that it doesn't work well with other perks like "Repressed Alliance". Hence, this macro comes in handy.
* **Flashlight spam**              &#8594; will press the right mouse button repeatedly
  * Just for fun and for catching survivor's or killer's attention. It is for the sake of completeness that I included this here but a mouse software macro will be better than this one.

# Is this bannable?
No. This macro provides no competitive advantage for playing the game, nor does it intrude or hook into the game's process code or memory. It just offers alternative key bindings and/or automates minor actions that can be performed manually without skill requirement.


  
# How to install?
It's very simple and you have 2 choices:
1. Simplest way (using .exe file): Just download the exe file from the [releases page](https://github.com/nickyramone/dbd-macros/releases) and run it.
2. Using source script: Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com); download [dbd_macros.ahk](https://github.com/nickyramone/dbd-macros/blob/master/dbd_macros.ahk) from this site (or just copy/paste the script to a file of your own) and double click on it.

After the macro is actively running, you will find an icon in the tray bar. You can also use the context menu on this icon to stop running the macro.
