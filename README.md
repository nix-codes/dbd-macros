# What is this?
This project consists of a series of very simple macros for "Dead By Daylight" game that help to reduce the strain on your wrist as well as the wear and tear of your keyboard, especially if you dedicate thousands of hours to playing it.


# What can it do?
Action                                       | Hotkey for enabling                     | Hotkey for disabling
---------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------
**Hold M1** (repairing gens; healing; etc.)  | _Hold \<Left Mouse Button\> + \<Tab\>_  | _\<Left/Right Mouse Click\>_
**Hold M2** (healing; using toolbox; etc.)   | _Hold \<Right Mouse Button\> + <Tab\>_  | _\<Right/Right Mouse Click\>_
**Wiggle on killer's shoulders**             | _Hold \<~\>_                            |
**Struggle on hook**                         | _\<Tab\>_                               | _\<Tab\>_
**Activate ability**                         | _\<Mouse wheel down\>_                  |
**Flashlight spam**                          | _Hold \<Middle Mouse Button\>_          |

## Note:
The above actions depend on DBD config to be using the default keys for those actions.
* **Struggle on hook** &#8594; will press "space" key repeatedly
* **Activate ability** &#8594; will press "E" key when the mouse wheel scrolls down
* **Flashlight spam**  &#8594; will press the right mouse button repeatedly
* **Hold M1**          &#8594; will keep the left mouse button down
* **Hold M2**          &#8594; will keep the right mouse button down

# Is this bannable?
No. This macro provides no competitive advantage for playing the game. It just offers alternative key bindings and/or automates minor actions that can be performed manually without skill requirement.


# How to install?
It's very simple and you have 2 choices:
1. Simplest way (using .exe file): Just download the exe file from the [releases page](https://github.com/nickyramone/dbd-macros/releases) and run it.
2. Using source script: Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com); download [dbd_macros.ahk](https://github.com/nickyramone/dbd-macros/blob/master/dbd_macros.ahk) from this site (or just copy/paste the script to a file of your own) and double click on it.

After the macro is actively running, you will find an icon in the tray bar. You can also context menu on this icon to stop running the macro.
